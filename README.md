# When the code will be available?

Unfortunately, we will have to wait a few months before releasing this source code. This research was partially funded by LG, and because of that, their agreement is necessary to share this with the scientific community. Despite their initial good signaling on this, we still don't have their permission, thus we will have to wait for it or at the latest the end of LG's exclusive use of the technology period. We are deeply sorry for that, and we would like to reinforce our beliefs that scientific knowledge should be open and available for everyone.
